# Alberta Schools Explorer - Backend

"Backend" is maybe a little grandiose - this is the part of the project where the data, &c. should be stored, created, manipulated, &c. Once it has been suitably massaged, it should go into the "/public/data" folder in the frontend, where it can be loaded into the frontend application.

In the future, this may become an actual backend - for now this is probably OK.
